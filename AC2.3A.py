The program code is developed for users to input two numbers, which are calculated using various mathematical functions through the use of a menu option.  To select the method for carrying out a particular mathematical operation.   

Each operation is encapulated inside its own function and uses a while loop, so the program stays open until the user chooses to exit

    """Returns the sum of two numbers."""

def subtract(x, y):
    """Returns the difference of two numbers."""
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    """Returns the product of two numbers."""
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    """Returns the quotient of two numbers. Handles division by zero."""
    if y == 0:
        return "Error! Division by zero is not allowed."
    return x / y
